JavaScript Part 2 Project

Welcome to my 5th projet / Homeowrk Assignment

The Premise of this project is that users will have to answer questions related to the marvel comic book heroes. 

There is 30 second timer with a 4 secondd pause between questions.

There is a GIF that displays when the user has pressed a neccessary action.
